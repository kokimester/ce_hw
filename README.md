Homework for consumer electronics subject.
The project will consist of a Unity project with VR settings.
The game is a fruit ninja ripoff, with simple solutions regarding physics.
# Platform
The goal of the project is to be cross-platform, but the main focus is on making it work on Windows, then if I have more time, I will implement a Linux version.Afaik Unity is capable of that.
# Headset
For testing, I will be using an Oculus Quest 2 headset with 2 controllers. For obvious reasons, I don't really have access to other headsets ATM, so expect bugs with other type of hardware.
